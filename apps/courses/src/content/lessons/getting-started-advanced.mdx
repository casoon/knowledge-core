# Advanced Features

In this lesson we show all available features and how to combine them.

## Dark Mode Support

All components automatically support dark mode. Users can switch between light and dark mode via the icon in the navigation.

<Callout type="info" title="CSS Variables">
Colors are defined via CSS variables. You can find them in `packages/styles/src/tokens.css`.
</Callout>

## Responsive Design

The entire layout is developed mobile-first:

<Tabs tabs={[
  { label: 'Mobile', value: 'mobile' },
  { label: 'Tablet', value: 'tablet' },
  { label: 'Desktop', value: 'desktop' }
]}>
  <TabPanel value="mobile">
    ### Mobile (< 768px)
    
    - Hamburger menu for navigation
    - Stacked layouts
    - Touch-optimized buttons
    - Adjustable font size
  </TabPanel>
  
  <TabPanel value="tablet">
    ### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
    
    - Optional sidebar display
    - 2-column grids
    - More space for content
  </TabPanel>
  
  <TabPanel value="desktop">
    ### Desktop (> 1024px)
    
    - Full sidebar visible
    - 3-column layouts possible
    - Keyboard navigation
    - Hover effects
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Nested Components

Components can be nested arbitrarily:

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Note">
<Hint title="Hidden tip in a callout">
You can nest components! This enables complex, interactive content.

```javascript
// Even code blocks work here
const nested = true;
```
</Hint>
</Callout>

## Difficulty Levels for Exercises

<Exercise title="Easy Exercise" difficulty="easy">
**Goal:** Create a simple callout component.

Add the following code to an MDX file:

```mdx
<Callout type="success">
  My first callout!
</Callout>
```
</Exercise>

<Exercise title="Medium Exercise" difficulty="medium">
**Goal:** Combine tabs with code examples.

Create tabs that show the same code in different programming languages:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript  
- Python

Use the `Tabs` and `TabPanel` components.
</Exercise>

<Exercise title="Hard Exercise" difficulty="hard">
**Goal:** Create a complete course.

1. Create a new course definition in `content/courses/`
2. Add at least 3 lessons
3. Use all component types:
   - Callouts (all 4 types)
   - Tabs with code examples
   - Quiz with 5+ questions
   - Exercises in all difficulty levels
   - Hints for tips
4. Test the progress tracking
</Exercise>

## Cloud Sync Feature

<Callout type="info" title="Sync Progress">
Learning progress can be synchronized across different devices. Click the cloud icon in the navigation to open the sync dialog.

**How it works:**
1. Export your progress as a code
2. Import the code on another device
3. Your progress is restored
</Callout>

## Full-Text Search

The integrated search is based on **Pagefind** and indexes all content automatically:

- Searches documentation and courses
- Finds headings, text, and code
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd + K`
- Works completely client-side

<Hint title="Optimize Search">
Pagefind indexes automatically on build. For best results:
- Use descriptive headings
- Use semantic HTML
- Add keywords to the frontmatter
</Hint>

## Accessibility

All components are accessible:

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Full |
| Screen Reader | ARIA labels |
| Focus Management | Visible focus rings |
| Contrast | WCAG AA compliant |
| Reduced Motion | `prefers-reduced-motion` |
