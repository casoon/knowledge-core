# Welcome to Knowledge Core

This is a sample lesson that shows you how courses work in Knowledge Core.

## What is Knowledge Core?

Knowledge Core is a **monorepo template** for:

- 📚 **Technical Documentation** - API docs, guides, tutorials
- 🎓 **Course Platforms** - Interactive learning paths
- 💡 **Knowledge Bases** - Internal knowledge databases

<Callout type="info" title="Tip for Template Users">
This is example content! You can customize it or replace it with your own content.
Check SETUP.md for instructions.
</Callout>

## Platform Features

### 1. MDX-based Content

All content is written in **MDX** - Markdown with React components:

```mdx
# Heading

Normal text with **bold** and *italic*.

<Callout type="success">
Interactive component!
</Callout>
```

### 2. Interactive Elements

You can use components like Callouts, Quizzes, Exercises, and more.

### 3. Progress Tracking

The platform can track your learning progress (localStorage-based).

<Hint title="For Developers">
The entire source code is open source! You can customize and extend everything.
Check out the components in `packages/ui/src/components/`.

## Course Structure

Courses are organized into:

1. **Courses** - Top-level containers (JSON definitions)
2. **Modules** - Thematic groupings
3. **Lessons** - Individual learning units (MDX)
